# gusbot
A Discord bot with a few Epic Mickey-related commands. Make sure to set up the required environment variables with your tokens before running. The environment variable names can be found and edited in constants.py.

This bot is designed first and foremost for my use, so while you are freely permitted to fork it and run it yourself, you may need to change certain hardcoded values - for example, the information provided in the $info command. This repo is provided mainly for the sake of transparency. I make no guarantees and cannot offer support for installing and using it yourself.
